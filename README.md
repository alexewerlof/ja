# Introduction

This is a very simple CLI utility to fetch files from Github into the current folder/repository.

Think about it as `curl` for Github.

* Lightweight
* Supports private repos and Github Enterprise
* Secure
* Descriptive error messages

### Use case

In our organization we have multiple js repos but some files need to be manually synced between them like: `.eslintrc`, `commit-message-validator.js`, etc.
We could use github submodules or any of the other fancy mechanisms, but copy/paste have been the king.
This little CLI allows us to set a source repo and copy the files in any other repository. It's not perfect, but it does the job.
Feedback is welcome.

## Install

```
$ npm i -g ja
```

## Usage

Create a `.ja` file in the root of your project in this format: 

```
# Comments
URL1 > LOCAL_FILE_PATH_1
URL2 > LOCAL_FILE_PATH_2
```

Example:

```
# This is just a test
https://github.com/userpixel/micromustache/blob/master/.gitignore > .gitignore

https://github.com/userpixel/pk/blob/master/package.json > packages/package.json
```

* Each line simply contains a URL and a local file name.
* The local file name can contain a path.
* The local file name path is relative to the current directory where the `.ja` file is located.
* For security reasons no absolute path is allowed.
* For security reasons the local file name *cannot* point to any directory that is the parent of the directory where the `.ja` file is located.
* Empty lines and lines beginning with `#` will be ignored.

**Commit all your changes before running `ja` because it'll overwrite the local files.**

Then simply run

```
$ ja
```

It'll first fetch all the files from those URLs and then rewrites them to local file paths.

* If the fetch step fails, it will not write any files.
* If the local folder doesn't exist it creates it.
* If the file doesn't exist it creates it.
* If the file already exists, it rewrites it. Any file permission will not be changed.
* It writes in utf-8 format
* It won't do anything if it cannot find a `.ja` file in the local directory.

# Token

If you are trying to access Github Enterprize or a private repository, you need a token to access the API.
`ja` gets this token from the environment variable.

### Generating the token

This is a one-time process:

1. Click on your github profile and go to **Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens**
2. Click **Generate new token**
3. Give your token a name and for the scope, only choose **public_repo** (that's all that is needed)
4. Press the **Generate token** button and _make sure to copy your token to a safe place because it's the last time you see it (don't worry you can always go there and make a new one)_ 

### Passing the token

`ja` expects the token in an environment variable named after the host name of the source URL.
For example the token for accessing `github.com` can be stored in `GITHUB_COM_TOKEN` environment variable.
If your Github Enterprise is hosted under `github.companyname.io`, the env var is `GITHUB_COMPANYNAME_IO_TOKEN`.

There are many ways to pass an environment variable to an application:

* You can put it in your `~/.bashrc` (Linux) or `~/.bash_profile` (Mac)
* You can pass it directly when running `ja` like this: `GITHUB_COM_TOKEN=328948kksjkafhdskjf ja`

The first method is easier because you do it once and then can run `ja` without any extra hassle.
